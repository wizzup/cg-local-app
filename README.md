# CG Local Application

This application should be used together with [cg-local-ext](https://github.com/jmerle/cg-local-ext). The application watches the selected file and sends the source code to the WebExtension when the file is changed.

## Installation
The application is distributed as a runnable jar. This jar only contains a launcher, which automatically pulls in the latest version when you run the application. Download the application [here](https://jaspervanmerle.com/cg-local/files/CG%20Local.jar).

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome, just make sure you send your pull requests towards the development branch.
